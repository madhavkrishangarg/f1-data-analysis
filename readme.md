## Formula 1 Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Formula 1 race data and build machine learning models to predict race winners based on various features. It provides insights into driver performance, constructor statistics, and race outcomes.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains necessary data files for the project.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and machine learning code.

## Steps for Data Analysis
1. **ASK**: Formulate relevant questions to guide the analysis.
2. **PREPARE**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **PROCESS**: Process the data to extract meaningful insights.
4. **ANALYSE**: Analyze the data to answer the formulated questions.
5. **SHARE**: Present findings and suggestions in a clear format.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation.
- Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Implements machine learning models to predict race outcomes.

## Questions Addressed
- Which driver has the most Grand Prix wins?
- Who is the top constructor with the most wins?
- What is the relationship between starting position and finishing position?

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Data Sources
The project uses the Formula 1 Dataset available on Kaggle. [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)
